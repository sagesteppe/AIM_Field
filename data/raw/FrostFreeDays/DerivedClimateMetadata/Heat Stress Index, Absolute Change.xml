      <abstract>The National Forest Climate Change Maps project provides information on projected climate changes at a scale relevant to decision-making process, including forest plans to meet the needs of national forest managers. The maps use the best available science and are available for every national forest with relevant data coverage. The datasets include variables related to precipitation and air temperature, for both historical data and future projections. These datasets were created using 20-model averages of downscaled climate data from MACA-v2METDATA (https://climate.northwestknowledge.net/MACA/). For more information about this project, see https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/boise/AWAE/projects/national-forest-climate-change-maps.html. This dataset represents the absolute change between the value in the historical (1975-2005) and future (2071-2090, RCP 8.5) time periods of the heat stress index (HSI), the average number of days per year when the temperature-humidity index (a function of temperature and relative humidity) exceeds the recommended threshold for beef cattle, for the contiguous United States. For more information about these methods, see Reeves and Bagne 2016: https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs/rmrs_gtr343.pdf.</abstract>

        <procdesc>Daily temperature and humidity data were downloaded as netCDF files from MACAv2METDATA (http://thredds.northwestknowledge.net:8080/thredds/reacch_climate_CMIP5_macav2_catalog2.html) for each of 20 general circulation models (GCMs). R scripts were used to a) download the data, b) open each netCDF file, then for each year: calculate the average daily temperature and average daily relative humidity from the daily minimum and maximum values for each of these, c) use these values to calculate the daily temperature-humidity index (THI), defined as 0.8 × Tair + RH × (Tair - 14.4) + 46.4, d) use these values to calculate the heat stress index (HSI), defined as the number of days per year with a THI greater than 74, the threshold value to trigger a heat stress alert for beef cattle e) calculate the annual average HSI using all years of the historical and future time periods, f) average the values for all 20 models, and g) find the absolute change between the historical and future time periods, and h) export these results as a raster.

        <enttypd>A spatial data model that defines space as an array of equally sized cells

                    structure, which stores coordinates explicitly, raster coordinates are contained
                    in the ordering of the matrix. Groups of cells that share the same value
                    represent the same type of geographic feature.</enttypd>
