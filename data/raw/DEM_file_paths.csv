In most of Alaska only lower resolution source data are available. As a result most seamless 3DEP data for Alaska are at 2 arc-second (approximately 60 meters) grid spacing. Part of Alaska is available at the 1 and 1/3 arc-second resolutions from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (ifsar) collections starting in 2010.  Plans are in place for collection of statewide ifsar in Alaska. All 3DEP products are public domain.,processingUrl,2021-12-01
